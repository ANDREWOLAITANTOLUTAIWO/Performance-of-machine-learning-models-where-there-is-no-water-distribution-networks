The aim of this study is to examine performance of machine learning models for predicting volume of water consumed by poor urban households where there is no WDN. Though there is WDN in rich areas nearby, yet the urban poor live in slums where there is no WDN, and so they pay heavily for drinking water, which is provided by private businesses through vending. Safe water consumption directly affects people’s wellbeing, productivity and ability to escape the trap of poverty. United Nations-Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG) recommends equal right to quality water for both the rich and the poor (WGF, 2012).  This study is necessary to provide solution to the problem of access to clean water within poor urban areas in low-income countries. Accurately predicting volume of water consumed is the first step towards extending WDN to poor urban areas, and solving the problem of lack of access to clean water.
